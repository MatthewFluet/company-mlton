https://github.com/MatthewFluet/company-mlton/[`company-mlton`] is a
http://company-mode.github.io/[`company-mode`] completion back-end for
http://mlton.org/[MLton]/Standard{nbsp}ML.  It provides completion for
Standard{nbsp}ML keywords and for Standard{nbsp}ML (long) identifiers.
Candidate completion identifiers for the latter are loaded from a
basis file created by `mlton` using ``-show-basis{nbsp}__file__`` or
``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}``.

== Usage

Completion candidates for Standard{nbsp}ML (long) identifiers are
loaded from a basis file created by `mlton` using
``-show-basis{nbsp}__file__`` or
``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}``.

=== Default Basis

`company-mlton` ships with a default basis file that corresponds to
MLton's default environment (implicitly used by `mlton` when compiling
a `.sml` file).  It includes the
http://sml-family.org/Basis/index.html[Standard ML Basis Library],
`structure Unsafe: UNSAFE`, `structure SMLofNJ: SML_OF_NJ`, and
`structure MLton: MLTON` (plus supporting signatures).  This default
basis is automatically used for `sml-mode` buffers that do not set the
buffer-local variable `company-mlton-basis-file`.  Thus, it provides
useful completion for single-file `.sml` programs.

=== Custom Basis Workflows

For larger Standard{nbsp}ML programs, it can be more useful to load a
custom basis file created by `mlton` using
``-show-basis{nbsp}__file__`` or
``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}``.

==== Using ``-show-basis{nbsp}__file__``

In some projects, a common set of utility libraries are used by many
source `.sml` files.  For example, consider a project described as
follows:

* `project.mlb`:
+
----
$(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb
$(SML_LIB)/smlnj-lib/Util/smlnj-lib.mlb
$(SML_LIB)/smlnj-lib/Controls/controls-lib.mlb
../lib/PrettyPrint/PrettyPrint.mlb
../lib/ParserCombinators/ParserCombinators.mlb

src1.sml
src2.sml
main.sml
----

Within `src1.sml`, `src2.sml`, and `main.sml`, it would be useful to
complete with the common set of libraries.  To do so, extract the
"imports" of `project.mlb` to `project-imports.mlb`:

* `project-imports.mlb`:
+
----
$(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb
$(SML_LIB)/smlnj-lib/Util/smlnj-lib.mlb
$(SML_LIB)/smlnj-lib/Controls/controls-lib.mlb
../lib/PrettyPrint/PrettyPrint.mlb
../lib/ParserCombinators/ParserCombinators.mlb
----
* `project.mlb`:
+
----
project-imports.mlb
main.sml
----

Now, save the environment described by `project-imports.mlb`:
----
mlton -show-basis project-imports.basis -stop tc project-imports.mlb
----

Finally, arrange for the buffer-local variable
`company-mlton-basis-file` to be set to `project-imports.basis` for
each source `.sml` file.  This can be accomplished by any of the
following:

* Execute `M-x company-mlton-basis-load` after loading a source `.sml`
  file and choose `project-imports.basis` at the prompt.
* Add a file-local variables `-*-` line to each of the source `.sml`
  files:
+
----
(* -*- company-mlton-basis-file: "project-imports.basis"; -*- *)
----
+
A file-local variables `-*-` line must be the first line of the file.
* Add a file-local variables `Local Variables:` block to each of the
  source `.sml` files:
+
----
(* Local Variables: *)
(* company-mlton-basis-file: "project-imports.basis" *)
(* End: *)
----
+
A file-local variables `Local Variables:` block is typically placed at
the end of the file.
* Add a `.dir-locals.el` file to the directory:
+
----
((sml-mode . ((company-mlton-basis-file . "project-imports.basis"))))
----

The advantage of the ``-show-basis{nbsp}__file__`` workflow is that
the custom basis file need only be created once (or whenever the
common set of libraries changes) and can be shared among many source
`.sml` files.  The disadvantage of the ``-show-basis{nbsp}__file__``
workflow is that the environment used for completion is not
specialized to each source `.sml` file.

==== Using ``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}``

More specialized completions for a particular source `.sml` file can
be provided by using ``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}``
directives.

A comment of the form ``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}`` in a
source `.sml` file is recognized by `mlton` as a directive to save the
environment at that point to ``__file__``.  The ``__file__`` is
interpreted relative to the source `.sml` file in which it appears.
The comment is lexed as a distinct token and is parsed as a
structure-level declaration.

Via `company-mlton-init` added to `sml-mode-hook`, comments of the
form ``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}`` are recognized when a
source `.sml` file is loaded and the buffer-local variable
`company-mlton-basis-file` is set to ``__file__``.  Similarly,
executing `M-x company-mlton-basis-autodetect` (or `M-x
company-mlton-init`) will scan the current buffer for comments of the
form ``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}`` and set the
buffer-local variable `company-mlton-basis-file` accordingly; this can
be used if the ``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}`` comment is
added after the source `.sml` file is loaded.

A ``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}`` directive can be used to
capture an environment that includes functor arguments, local
structure aliases, and local structure declarations.  For example,
consider writing a type-checker module as a functor, parameterized by
an abstract-syntax-tree represenation and a core representation and
defining an environment module by applying a functor:
----
functor TypeCheck
   (S: sig
          structure Ast: AST_IR
          structure Core: CORE_IR
       end):
   sig
      val typeCheck: Ast.Prog.t -> Core.Prog.t option
   end =
struct
   open S

   structure A = Ast
   structure C = Core
   structure E =
      MkEnv (structure Dom = A.Var
             structure Rng =
                struct
                   type t = C.Var.t * C.Type.t
                end)

   (*#showBasis "type-check.basis"*)

   fun typeCheck p = raise Fail "typeCheck"

end
----
Compile (or at least type check) the whole project (or at least the
portion of the project that includes `type-check.fun`) as usual.  The
environment saved to `type-check.basis` will include `structure A`,
`structure C`, and `structure E`, in addition to all identifiers in
scope at the start of the functor declaration.

The advantage of the ``{scom}#showBasis{nbsp}"__file__"{ecom}``
workflow is that the custom basis file can be specialized to each
source `.sml` file.
